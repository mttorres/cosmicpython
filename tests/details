"Nothing particularly clever here, just some separation
of different test types that you’re likely to want to run separately,
and some files for common fixtures, config, and so on.

There’s no src folder or setup.py in the test folders because we usually haven’t
needed to make tests pip-installable, but if you have difficulties with import
paths, you might find it helps."
